# College-of-Engineering-Accreditation-Project
This project is a website for PUP's College of Engineering 2021 Virtual Accreditation. The objective of this project is to bring a safe and convenient space for school accreditors to conduct this year's school accreditation. I am one of the developers of this project and was assigned for the Computer Engineering's accreditation website. I may not link the website to you in accordance to the schools' accreditation privacy. The soul purpose of this is a proof. However a google drive link is provided with a password to ensure privacy.
